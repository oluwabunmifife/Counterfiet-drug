# Steps for setting up your system to run the blockchain app

1. Install node(preferred IDE will be visual studio code)
2. Install truffle(npm install truffle --save)
3. download ganache for your operating system(Ganache is an open-source platform that helps you deploy web3 apps on the blockchain)
4. On the your terminal go to the project folder then run(truffle develop)
5. create a new terminal and also go to the project folder then run(truffle --migrate reset) # This is to deploy the smart contracts and the supply chain
6. After the migration is done run(npm install) # This is to install all the necessary packages you will be needing for the project
7. Once the installation is done, Run(npm start) # This is to start the web3 app and create the development server which will run on localhost:3000

# Now for you to be able to see the app on your browser you have to install the metamask extension for your chrome and then link your ganache account to it

Use the link above to learn how to do it. It is pretty easy.

Once that is done you will be able to see your blockchain app run on your web browser specifically chrome.

That is it!! and your app is up and running. I look forward to getting your feedback.
